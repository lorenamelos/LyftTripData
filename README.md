# LyftTripData

Exercise from CodeCademy Data Science Path. 

The project is explained as follows: 

Suppose you are a Data Analyst at Lyft, a ride-sharing platform. For a project, you were given three tables:

trips: trips information
riders: user data
cars: autonomous cars

From this three tables some queries are asked do be done, so we can explore the data - this is what I share here.
